* Release Notes
** <2018-05-30 Wed 13:42Z> ~test-0.13-websockets~
Binaries: <https://github.com/emotiq/emotiq/releases/tag/test-0.13-websockets>
Branch:   <https://github.com/emotiq/emotiq/compare/157484804-create-websocket-interface-20180530a>

1.  The HTTP testing implementation now works in the binary
    distribution, and may be interacted with as <http://locahost:3140/client/>.

2.  Implemented asynchronous messages to subscribe/unsubscribe with subsequent notifications.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
UI --> Emotiq {method: "subscribe", params: ["consensus"], id: 11}
UI indicates that it wants to subscribe to consensus events

UI <-- Emotiq { result: ["true"], id: 11}
Emotiq indicates that the subscription to events is successfull

Thereafter, asynchronous notifications are sent with thethe form
UI <-- Emotiq {method: "consensus", params: DATA1, id: null}
UI <-- Emotiq {method: "consensus", params: DATA2, id: null}
UI <-- Emotiq {method: "consensus", params: DATA3, id: null}

Then the UI can unsubscribe via
UI --> Emotiq {method: "unsubscribe", params: ["consensus"], id: 23}
to which Emotiq responds
UI <-- Emotiq {result: true, id: 23}
#+END_EXAMPLE

3.  Implemented "ping" method for simple request/response to detect
    node liveness.

4.  Documentation for message requests can be found as
