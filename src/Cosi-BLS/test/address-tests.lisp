;; Test notes: it may be helpful to test individual components of the
;; address.lisp code with the handy address tester here:
;;
;;   http://gobittest.appspot.com/Address 
;;
;; E.g., you can copy/paste what's in the blank labelled "1 - Public ECDSA Key"
;; into a Lisp string assigned to, say, variable *S*, and then you can do
;;
;;   (public-key-to-address (ironclad:hex-string-to-byte-array *s*) :override-version 0)
;;
;; Try with *S* = "0433F8C523B3FF52F0A515DD19EB88B1356BED642F5B9A55AE34D7481FE2EED2D36BDACAFD1A400910CDD1F3BB79A8C4D090C37180156BE25D2801D53DFA646066"
;; Result should be: "1ABD7Te3tqtMmdmYh432fSyB2fX3juS475"
;;
;; You can also put the above (or some other) public key into blank labelled "1
;; - Public ECDSA Key" at the test site and click the "send" button to verify
;; that it gets the same result.
