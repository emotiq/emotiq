;;;; Transaction Types

;;; A `transaction' in Emotiq Lisp software is implemented as an instance of class
;;; TRANSACTION. The Lisp type of an instance of this class is TRANSACTION. In
;;; the following discussion, however, the word "type" is used in its generic
;;; meaning, not Lisp/programming-language sense.

;;; Emotiq has six types of transactions:
;;;
;;;   - Spend transaction to transfer tokens, with two subtypes
;;;     - cloaked
;;;     - uncloaked
;;;   - Collect transaction for collecting block fees
;;;   - Stake transaction for sending tokens into PoS escrow
;;;   - Unstake transaction for withdrawing tokens from PoS escrow
;;;   - Slash trasaction to request punishment for a cheating node
;;;   - Disperse transaction to disperse tokens from a cheating node escrow between validators

;;; A transaction instance indentifies its type via its transaction-type slot,
;;; which should be set near the beginning of the life of the transaction
;;; initialized to one of the following valid values, which in turn determine
;;; valid values for other slots of a transaction.  A `transaction type' is
;;; represented as a Lisp keyword. The defined types so far are:
;;;
;;;   :spend -- for an uncloaked spend transaction
;;;   :spend-cloaked -- for a cloaked spend transaction
;;;   :collect -- for a collect transaction
;;;   :coinbase -- for the (one) transaction that creates coin (a/k/a the genesis transaction)




;;;; Transaction Objects



;;; When you use a transaction (TX), you always completely consume its
;;; output.  Any amount not sent to some other party is conventionally
;;; sent back to the sender's same address, which is then referred to
;;; as a so-called "change address".

;; ---!!! follow through with the other side of "segwit", that is, to create
;; ---!!! "witness hash" (a "WTXID") consisting of both the transaction and

;; ---!!! the Witness merkle root, which is put in an output of the coinbase
;; ---!!! transaction of the block. In Bitcoin it is held in an output of the
;; ---!!! Coinbase transaction, but that was only done for compatibility: they
;; ---!!! would have put it in the block if they could have done so compatibly,
;; ---!!! but putting it in an output of the coinbase transaction was the next
;; ---!!! best thing.  Decide whether to keep or discard the actual signature
;; ---!!! data as opposed to its hash (or possibly to have that be optional per

;;; SERIALIZE-TRANSACTION: emit all the fields that should be hashed in a
;;; transaction. Note: for now [Mar 26, 2018], we just hash all inputs and all
;;; outputs. We must review and refine later to have this be parameterized to
;;; hash parts depending on what the situation calls for.

;;; In Bitcoin, there is a SIGHASH type set of bits with meanings as follows:
;;;
;;;   flag val    what to sign
;;;   all  0x01   all inputs, all outputs
;;;   none 0x02   all inputs, no outputs
;;;   one  0x03   all inputs, one output w/same index as signed input
;;;
;;; (So, in effect, what we now do below is the all case.)

;;; The parts of an output (UTXO) hashed are
;;;
;;;   public key hash
;;;   amount
;;;   lock script
;;;
;;; The parts of an input hashed are
;;;
;;;   ID (the hash of a previous transaction input)
;;;   index

;;; ---***!!! FIX: coinbase transactions could rarely result duplicate
;;; ---***!!! TXID. Bitcoin BIP 30 made those not allowed (via a
;;; ---***!!! network rule)
;;; ---***!!! https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0030.mediawiki
;;; ---***!!! NB: for coinbase transactions, do as in Bitcoin BIP 34,
;;; ---***!!! which required coinbase transactions to include the
;;; ---***!!! height of the block they were mining in to their
;;; ---***!!! transaction data, so that coinbase transactions could be
;;; ---***!!! different.  This avoids the possibility of duplicate
;;; ---***!!! TXIDs. https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki#Motivation
;;; ---***!!! -mhd, 6/4/18

;;; Normally, you do not have block info - most normal transactions
;;; are created in wallet client.  Think about how to implement this
;;; feature. Only needed for case of creating a coinbase transaction,
;;; created by miners/minters when a block is created.

;;;; Genesis Block Creation

;;; In Bitcoin the first transaction of a block is created by a miner, and it's
;;; a special transaction with one input that's very wacky called a coinbase
;;; transaction with a so-called coinbase input. While every other transaction
;;; on the blockchain has as input a reference to a previous transaction, a
;;; coinbase transaction refers to a "null" transaction.

;;; Coinbase transaction are the main way coin gets into the system in
;;; Bitcoin. The other way is through transaction fees. In Bitcoin the miner who
;;; creates the block creates the coinbase transaction and is awarded the mining
;;; fee. The coinbase transaction issues one output to one address and that is
;;; to the miner's "wallet", i.e, their account (i.e., designated by their
;;; public key hash), and that is in the amount of the current block reward,
;;; which famously know gets halved every four years (currently [2018] 12.5
;;; BTC). So that's mining, and Emotiq does not feature mining.

;;; In addition to the mining reward, the coinbase transaction includes fees for
;;; the miner. That's a way for Bitcoin to pay a little more besides mining
;;; fees, and will be the only way miners get paid after miner awards approach
;;; and eventually reach zero.

;;; Now, since we, Emotiq, do not feature mining, what do we do at block
;;; creation time with the first transaction. I.e., how does the main amount of
;;; coin get into the system? Here is the answer.

;;; The Emotiq Whitepaper states that an initial supply of 10^9 coins will be
;;; created when EMTQ mainnet is launched. So, the genesis block would contain
;;; transactions paying 10^9 to one address (TBD), and from there onto others as
;;; desired.


;;;; Coin and Token Units

;;; NB: while the Emotiq Whitepaper talks of EMTQ tokens and EMTQ child tokens,
;;; this is probably simpler than what's there and probably does not match the
;;; level of sophistication implied there.

;;; At a later point we might switch to the term "token", but for now we're
;;; using coin", as follows.  

;;; A `coin unit' or more simply `unit' or `coin' (and plural versions with
;;; `units' or `coins') all refer the fully valued coin in the cyrpto currency
;;; here implemented.

;;; A `coin subunit' or `subunit' (plural `subunits') all refer to the smallest
;;; fraction of a coin unit.

;;; A `coin amount' or `amount' is a number of coin subunits.

;;; When expressing a number of units messages with users, it is fine to use
;;; floats or ratios, but as a coding convention internally we use integer math
;;; only, via the following constants.

;;; The following is from the OmniLedger paper. We would like to incorporate
;;; this into transaction processing.  This is referred to as "V. B." in the
;;; "Emotiq Yellow Paper" in our repo
;;; online. (https://github.com/emotiq/yellowpaper/blob/master/yellowpaper.md).
;;;
;;;   B. Parallelizing Block Commitments We now show how ByzCoinX parallelizes
;;;   block commitments in the UTXO model by carefully analyzing and handling
;;;   dependencies between transactions. We observe that transactions that do
;;;   not conflict with each other can be committed in different blocks and
;;;   consequently can be safely processed in parallel. To identify conflicting
;;;   transactions, we need to analyze the dependencies that are possible
;;;   between transactions. Let txA and txB denote two transactions. Then, there
;;;   are two cases that need to be carefully handled: (1) both txA and txB try
;;;   to spend the same UTXO and (2) an UTXO created at the output of txA is
;;;   spent at the input of txB (or vice versa). To address (1) and maintain
;;;   consistency, only one of the two tx can be committed. To address (2), txA
;;;   has to be committed to the ledger before txB,i.e., txB has to be in a
;;;   block that depends (transitively) on the block containing txA. All
;;;   transactions that do not exhibit these two properties can be processed
;;;   safely in parallel. In particular we remark that transactions that credit
;;;   the same address do not produce a conflict, because they generate
;;;   different UTXOs To capture the concurrent processing of blocks, we adopt a
;;;   block-based directed acyclic graph (blockDAG) [33] as a data structure,
;;;   where every block can have multiple parents. The ByzCoinX protocol leader
;;;   enforces that each pending block includes only non-conflicting
;;;   transactions and captures UTXO dependencies by adding the hashes of former
;;;   blocks (i.e.,backpointers) upon which a given block’s transactions
;;;   depend. To decrease the number of such hashes, we remark that UTXO
;;;   dependencies are transitive, enabling us to relax the requirement that
;;;   blocks have to capture all UTXO dependencies directly. Instead, a given
;;;   block can simply add backpointers to a set of blocks, transitively
;;;   capturing all dependencies.
;;;
;;; Here is the referenced "blockDAG" paper URL (Inclusive Block Chain
;;; Protocols):
