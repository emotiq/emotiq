(in-package :cosi-keying)

;; NOTE: The adopted standard for Emotiq (for now) is:
;;    Hashes are hex strings, Binary data are base58 strings. And
;;    while keying uses hashing internally, published keying info is
;;    binary, not hashes. So key info will be presented as base64
;;    strings.
;;
;;    Users are identified by public key.

;; Bloom filter sizing.... Suppose we want false positives rate
;; P_false < 0.001, number of hashes needed is K = -log2 p = 9.97 =
;; 10, and bits/item M/N = -1.44 Log2 p = 14.35. Suppose further, that
;; we plan for N = 1M items in the filter.
;;
;; We can chop up the bits of a hash like SHA256 for use as the
;; separate hash values, easier to do if we just use whole octets from
;; the hash directly. And keeping M as a power of 2, enables just
;; masking the hash value with 2^m-1 for indexing into the bit table..
;;
;; For 1M items, we need M = 14.35M bits => 16M or 24 bit addressing.
;; With 10 hashes, we need 240 bits of hash overall. And the bit table
;; will occupy 2 MB of memory.
;;
;; Pkeys are all at least 249 bits, so we are okay with just using the
;; Pkey as the source of hash values for the Bloom filter. We just
;; need to convert them into a little-endian vector of bytes.
;;
;; Note that no space is saved if we settle for p = 0.01 instead of
;; 0.001. The only thing that happens with higher false positive
;; probability is that we need only 7 hashes instead of 10.
