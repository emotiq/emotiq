To get the simulator to work on a single machine:

> (ql:quickload :emotiq/sim)

change addresses in cosi-sim.lisp
ensure that there is a directory Cosi-BLS/config/
change *local-nodes* in cosi-construction.lisp (1st in list is the main node)

> (in-package :cosi-simgen)

> (cosi-init)

should print a string containing IP

> (cosi-generate)

under LW it brings up a window ("container") that shows a tree of faked nodes (red are real nodes, black are faked)

> (init-sim)

> (tst)
> (tst-blk)

output to Output-Browser (LW) should be



"Construct Genesis transaction" 
"Find UTX for Mary" 
"Construct 2nd transaction" 

(output is done with CL:PRINT)
