The simulation can be configured to run across the number of EXECUTIVE-THREADS 

COSI-PREPARE-TIMEOUT specifies how many seconds that cosi leaders wait
for responses during prepare phase.  The default value is 40.  For
simulations involving computational expensive cloaked transactions
across many nodes, this value may need to be larger to allow the
blocks to be sealed.

COSI-COMMIT-TIMEOUT specifies how many seconds that cosi leaders wait
for responses during commit phase.

Prepare can possibly take longer than commit, because the block may contain txns that a witness has not
yet seen (and, therefore, needs to validate the unseen txn(s))

If either NEW-CONFIGURATION-P is true or the simulator has never been
run on this node, a new simulation network will be generated.  The
configured simulation will have the integer number of NODES as
witnesses.  

N.B. :nodes has no effect unless a new configuration has been triggered (see above)."

;; To do: spend a few minutes seeing if there's already a CL-REPL
;; someone did (open source), especially one integrated with SLIME?

;; To do: wrap some error handling to catch simple read errors, catch
;; if they really want to exit to top level, etc.  For example, if you
;; type in a variable name that's unbound, and it pops you into a
;; debugger, and you abort from debugger, it should return to this
;; REPL, not to the Lisp REPL.

;; To do: should have Lisp's REPL variables set (*, **, ***, +, ++,
;; +++).

;; To do/sad: in SLIME when this prompts, you lose SLIME
;; completion. How to get that back?
