;; NOTE: The adopted standard for Emotiq (for now) is:
;;    Hashes are hex strings, Binary data are base58 strings. And
;;    while keying uses hashing internally, published keying info is
;;    binary, not hashes. So key info will be presented as base64
;;    strings.
;;
;;    Users are identified by public key.
