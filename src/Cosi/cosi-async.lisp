;; Single message Schnorr Signatures.
;; Signatures of this type will make up the collective signature.
;;
;; In the following:
;;
;;  v,V = v*G = a commitment value
;;  c = a challenge value, typically c = Hash(V|m),
;;       for message m. This is the Fiat-Shamir challenge.
;;  r = a cloaked signature value = (v - c*k_s) mod r_ec,
;;       for private key k_s, prime modulus r_ec = #|K/h|,
;;       #|K/h| = (the prime order of the curve field),
;;       #|K| = prime order of field in which curve is embedded,
;;       h = cofactor of curve field. r_ec*G = I, the point at infinity.
;;       Points on the EC are computed over prime field q_ec, not r_ec.
;;  sig = a pair = (c r)
;;
;;  Verfied as V' = r*G + c*K_p, c ?= Hash(V'|m),
;;  for public key K_p, message m.
;;
;; When offered a challenge, we compute a commitment, and form the
;; signature from them. The signature caries both a cloaked signature
;; value and the challenge.  Verifiers should be able to use those two
;; values, in combination with our known public key, to verify the
;; signature.
;;
;; NOTE: We must offer a cloaked signature using value r from the
;; isomorphic prime field underlying the EC. If, instead, we were to
;; offer up points along the curve, as in:
;;    sig' = (c R), for R = V - c*K_p,
;; for public key K_p, then anyone could forge a signature knowing
;; only the public key K_p. We gain security through ECDLP and difficulty
;; of inverting the hash.
;;
;; Barriers to attack:
;;    1. get V from c = H(V|m), very difficult for good hash H.
;;    2. knowing V = v*G from inverse hash (!?), ECDLP to find v,
;;       very difficult.
;;    3. knowing (c, r) from sig, v = r + c*k_s can't be solved for v
;;       without knowing k_s secret key. Could be anywhere along a line.
;;       And since prime field is large >2^252, Birthday attack requires
;;       almost >2^128 trials.
;;
;; In distributed cosign the secret v value is communicated to other
;; cosigners. We need to ensure that it is transported securely. It is
;; a random value in the prime field isomorphic to the EC group.
;;
;; Since c = Hash(V|m) this signature also authenticates the message
;; m.  Value c serves as challenge and message authentication. Value r
;; in signature serves as undeniable signature of sender (assuming
;; he/she keeps k_s a secret).

  ;; 
  ;; The Schnorr signature is computed over ECC in a manner analogous
  ;; to prime fields. (In fact we have to use the prime field of the
  ;; curve here.)
  ;;
  ;; Value c is a presented challenge value. Value v is a secret
  ;; random commitment seed, from which the challenge was computed.
  ;;
  ;; From the commitment seed v, challenge c, and secret key k_s, we
  ;; compute r = (v - c*k_s), in the prime field isomorphic to the EC.
  ;;

  ;;

;; Network node simulation
;;
;; A Cosi network is presumed to be a tree of cooperating nodes, with
;; each node having some numnber of peers under its direction. Each
;; node carries out a portion of the Cosi protocol, and combines its
;; result with those of its directed peers. The peers perform this
;; same action recursively. The top node of the tree submits the final
;; result.
;;
;; Every potential signature verifier node needs to know the public
;; keys of all cosigner nodes. Public keys aren't simply transmitted
;; to requestors, since attackers could substitute forged signature if
;; they desired. Rather, all requests for public keys from nodes must
;; be returned with an accompanying NIZKP to prove that the responding
;; node actually knows the private key associated with the public key.
;;
;; Collecting all these public keys and verifying the NIZKP's takes
;; considerable time for large Cosi networks. It also implies a lot of
;; network traffic.
;;
;; So rather than forcing the verifiers to go out and request public
;; keys from all the cosigners, we include the cosigner public keys
;; with their individual ZKP's as part of the overall message
;; signature. This roughly triples the signature size, to around 114
;; bytes / cosigner key. But that likely pales in comparison to
;; constant network traffic. Verifier nodes can cache fully verified
;; public keys so they don't need to repeat the proof verification.
