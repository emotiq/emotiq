         ==  Reed-Solomon Code Interpretation of Shamir Sharing ==

   c.f., "SCRAPE: Scalable Randomness Attested by Public Entities", by Cascudo and David

Alternative is to treat list of shares S_ik as code word of Reed-Solomon [n,k,n-k+1].
Instead of publishing proofs on coeffs of polynomial, we publish proofs on the shares S_ik,
and validate by checking for orthogonality in the dual space of the RS Code.

Consider just one node for now:

Pick a random polynomial f(x) of degree t-1 with coeffs a_i. We must
use t = sharing threshold = f + 1 for BFT. Number of nodes n = 3*f + 1.

  f(x) = Sum(x^i * a_i, i = 0 .. t-1), where a_0 = secret value

and

  a_i = Rnd(i)

Let                   x_j = H(P_j) in Zr
Form the shares       s_j = f(x_j) in Zr,
Form encrypted shares S_j = s_j * P_j, all in G2, j = 1..n
Form the proofs       V_j = s_j * G1, all in G1, j = 1..n
Publish shares and proofs to all nodes 1..n

Each node checks share validity by noting that e(V_j,P_j) = e(G1,S_j), j = 1..n
Check that shares form valid RS-Code by computing a random polynomial in the dual space:

    g(x) = Sum(x^i * b_i, i = 0..m <= n-t-1)

and
    b_i = Rnd(i) in Zr

Let  x_j = H(P_j) in Zr, same x_j as used in forming shares,
then form dual vector:

    c_j = d_j * g(x_j), j = 1..n, in Zr

where

    d_j = Prod(1/(j-i),  i /= j, i = 1..n), in Zr

Then show that Sum(c_j * V_j, j = 1..n) = I. This validates the entire
set {S_j} of shares as a valid RS-Code.

Now decrypt your node k share:

   SD_k = 1/p_k*S_k = 1/p_k*s_k*P_k = 1/p_k*s_k*p_k*G2 = s_k*G2, in G2

Publish decrypted share SD_k. Proof of SD_k is e(V_k,G2) = e(G1,SD_k),
V_k already public.

Anyone who sees #SD_k >= t = f+1 can use Lagrange interpolation to
derive final secret S = a_0 * G2.

   S = Sum(lam_j * SD_j, j = 1..m >= t), in G2

where

   lam_j = Prod(j/(j-i), i = 1..m, i /= j), in Zr


Here we choose degree of sharing polynomial f(x) as t-1, making a
[n,t,n-t+1] RS code from (S1,S2,...,Sn). The dual space polynomial
g(x) can have degree n-t-1, making a [n,n-t,t+1] RS code.

[n,m,l] := [length, dimension, distance]

|#
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#|
       In the end... The "Chinese" algorithm requires the publication of T + N values,
       corresponding to the N Shares and T Proofs of the sharing polynomial coefficients. (T << N)

       The Reed-Solomon requires publication of 2N values corrsponding to N Shares and N Proofs of Shares.

       So opt for the "Chinese" algorithm. Call it TPM for the authors initials.
