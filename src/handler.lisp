;; the code below creates a hierarchical dispatcher - it grabs 3 messages (:hold-an-election ,:make-block and :block-finished)
;; and deals with them, all other messages are sent downwards, to cosi-simgen::node-dispatcher

;; I have specifically not used dlambda, in hopes of demonstrating that a msg is very simple and can be pulled apart using
;; simple Lisp functions

;; :block-finished is a "new" message that is sent by the leader to itself in cosi-handlers, at the end of the COMMIT
;; phase, for synchronization, i.e. the Leader goes through the various phases (prepare and commit), then signals to
;; itself that COMMIT is finished (since everything is asynchronous, we can't know when the COMMIT has finished, other
;; than by sending a message).
