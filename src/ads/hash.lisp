;; We focus on SHA3 for post-Quantum security. Any hash of N bits has
;; inherent security of 2^(N/2) by virtue of the Birthday Attack.
;; Grover's quantum algorithm further degrades that by Sqrt(2^N)
;; giving security of Sqrt(Sqrt(2^N)) => N/4 bits. SHA3 produces 512
;; bit hashes (64 octets), for a post quantum security level of 128
;; bits.
;;
;; For comparison, the SHA256, so often used, will have only 64 bits
;; of security. The generally accepted minimum security level is 80
;; bits.  So SHA256 will be insufficient in a post-quantum world.
;;
;; Additionally, the sponge algorithm used by SHA3 exhibits greater
;; quantum resistance than the Merkle-Damgard operations carried out
;; in SHA256.  As of this date (01/18) nothing less than SHA256 is
;; recommended.
;;
;; The SHA256 family was developed and certified c.a. 2001-2004. SHA3
;; was certified in 2015, giving 10 years of research effort more.

;; There are several ways to express the result of H(A|B|C), for
;; concatenated items A, B, and C. You could use HASHEM as shown here,
;; where A, B, and C are successively accumulated into the hash. Or
;; you could first encode (A|B|C) as a ub8v and hash that single
;; vector. The two hash values will differ, but both are legitimate
;; representations. The key is to be consistent, however you do it.
;;
;; The usual approach is to perform successive accumulation into the
;; hash digest. But that misses the structural form of the
;; concatenation, which a ub8v representation would capture along with
;; the values. If structure is important, i.e., list of values vs
;; vector of values, then you should prefer the ub8v encoding for
;; disambiguation.
