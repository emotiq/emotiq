  "Start a new transport node that accepts connections on ADDRESS:PORT.
   The transport node executes asynchronously in the background and
   runs callback functions when important events occur. The callback
   functions are assumed to return promptly without blocking.

   The callback (MESSAGE-RECEIVED-HOOK MESSAGE) is called each time a
   message is received from a peer. The message is a byte array and
   the hook function is assumed to perform all necessary processing
   for the message.

   The callback (PEER-UP-HOOK ADDRESS PORT) is called each time a new
   connection with a peer is (re)established. The connection can be
   triggered by either an outbound or an inbound connection.

   The callback (PEER-DOWN-HOOK ADDRESS PORT REASON) is called each
   time an existing connection goes down (e.g. due to timeout or
   connectivity trouble) and also whenever a new outgoing connection
   cannot be established (e.g. peer address is not reachable within a
   reasonable timeframe.) 
   The reason is a human-readable string suitable for logging.

   The callback (LOG-EVENT-HOOK STRING &rest ARGS) is called when
   events occur that can be significant for troubleshooting. The
   string and arguments are fre-form with no specific format.

   BACKEND and BACKEND-PARAMETERS optionally specify additional
   low-level and implementation-specific parameters.

   Returns an object representing the transport node or raises an
   error if the node could not be started (e.g. because the
   address/port was not available.)"

   The transport layer will take pains to deliver the message
   promptly, including automatically (re)establishing connectivity
   with the node and queueing the message during temporary
   connectivity problems, but no guarantee is made.

   The transport layer does not provide message delivery
   receipts (ack/nak). This means that the layer above is responsible
   for handling the possibility that any given message is not
   delivered (e.g. using timeouts and explicitly acknowledgement
   messages.)"
