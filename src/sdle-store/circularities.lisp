;; Defines a special backend type which specializes various methods
;; in plumbing.lisp to make it nice and easy to 
;; resolve possible circularities in objects.
;; Most of the work is done using the resolving-object
;; macro which knows how to handle an object which 
;; is a referrer to a previously restored value.
;; Backends wanting to make use of this should take
;; a look at default-backend.lisp and xml-backend.lisp
;; paying special attention to the defbackend form and the 
;; defrestore definitions for cons, array, simple-vector
;; array and hash-table.
;;
;; As a note this will ignore integers, symbols or characters
;; as referrer values. It will handle all other EQ number although
;; software depending on eq numbers are not conforming 
;; programs according to the Hyperspec(notes in EQ).
