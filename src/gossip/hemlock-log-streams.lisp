#+EXAMPLE
(if (find-package :gui)
    (setf emotiq:*notestream* (funcall (intern "MAKE-LOG-WINDOW" :gui) "Emotiq Log"))
    (setf emotiq:*notestream* *error-output*))
; 24-Jun-2018
; The above works, but these hemlock streams are much too slow when they get to a couple 
;  thousand lines.

(in-package :gui)

(export '(MAKE-LOG-WINDOW) :gui)

ALL modifications to buffers should be done from the gui thread.
gui::execute-in-gui or gui::queue-for-gui.
Reads from buffers can be done from any thread, but beware that
they might not be consistent since there is no locking.

Because you can't just call format on a hemlock-output-stream without
wrapping the call in one of the gui forms above, this breaks the
purity of the stream abstraction. So we wrap a gray stream
around this thing to get back that purity.
