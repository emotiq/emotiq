Discussion: :gossip style is more realistic for "loose" networks where nodes don't know much about their neighbors.
:neighborcast style is better after :gossip style has been used to discover the graph topology and agreements about collaboration
are in place between nodes.

To send a message that doesn't require a reply:
Use #'solicit.
To send a message that does require a reply:
Use #'solicit-wait.

To send a message that you want a direct response to:
Use #'solicit-direct and make your message manually with the :reply-to slot being the UID of the node that should expect all replies.

To send a message from a NODE that the node wants a direct response to:
The node should make the message manually with the :reply-to slot being the UID of the node itself.
The node should call (send-msg msg uid #'final-continuation), where uid is the UID of the node itself [yes, you send
the message to yourself] and final-continuation is a single-argument function of a reply, where that reply is the coalesced reply
the node itself would send upstream if it were an :UPSTREAM message. If final-continuation is nil, that reply just gets
dropped on the floor.

; NOTE A:
; If node X is ignoring a solicitation* from node Y because it already
; saw that solicitation, then it must also not expect a reply from node Y
; for that same solicitation.
; Here's why [In this scenario, imagine #'locally-receive-msg is acting on behalf of node X]:
; If node X ignores a solicition from node Y -- because it's already seen that solicitation --
;   then X knows the following:
;   1. Node Y did not receive the solicition from X. It must have received it from somewhere else,
;      because nodes *never* forward messages to their upstream.
;   2. Therefore, if X forwards (or forwarded) the solicitation to Y, Y
;      is definitely going to ignore it. Because Y has already seen it.
;   3. Therefore (to recap) if X just ignored a solicitation from Y, then X
;      knows Y is going to ignore that same solicitation from X.
;   4. THEREFORE: X must not expect Y to respond, and that's why
;      we call cancel-replier here. If we don't do this, Y will ignore
;      and X will eventually time out, which it doesn't need to do.
;   5. FURTHERMORE: Y knows X knows this. So it knows X will stop waiting for it.
;
; * we take no special action for non-solicitation messages because they can't
;   ever be replied to anyway.

DISCUSSION:
send-interim-reply needs to be delayed.
interim-replies don't resolve anything in the gossip model; they just provide (sometimes valuable)
partial information to the ultimate solicitor. However, if things are moving along properly,
a huge flurry of almost content-free interim-replies doesn't accomplish anything except to
clog up communication.

I don't want to get rid of interim-replies altogether because they'll be needed in cases of any
malfunctioning nodes. But I'd like to delay them a bit -- put them on the actor's back-burner
as it were.
Specifically what I need is a way to tell an actor
1. Put the send-interim-reply on the back burner and if nothing usurps it, execute it after a 1 second
delay.
2. If a send-final-reply happens, remove any send-interim-reply requests from the back-burner.
3. If a second send-interim-reply request comes in when one is already on the back-burner, do nothing,
because the original will take care of it. However, do reset the clock to make it execute 1 second
from now, rather than 1 second from whatever time the original request set up.

REMAINDER OF DISCUSSION IS OBSOLETE. WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH SEND-SELF NOW.

There are a couple of tricky issues here I don't know how to solve:
-- How to create a local "back-burner" queue on an actor. Conceivably this could just be another slot
on an actor, and #'next-message could be made to look at it last. Or possibly it could be put on the
actor-message-mbox at lowest priority?
-- How to ensure the actor gets put back on the *actor-ready-queue* 1 second from now.

Another solution might be to just give actors a "yield" capability such that they put themselves back
onto the far end of the *actor-ready-queue* and give other actors (or technically, other messages to
themselves) a chance to run first.

Can an actor be on the *actor-ready-queue* more than once? I would hope so. But no. The queue doesn't even
really contain actors per se; it just contains lexical closures, all of which are associated with some
actor. However, the way #'send works is that it never re-adds an actor's run closure to the queue if the
actor is already busy.

FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING ABOVE: An actor must *never* be on the ready queue more than once because then
it could be executed by two processes concurrently, and that's *never* allowed. All atomicity guarantees of
the actor model would dissolve under such a scenario.

I suppose the simplest solution is to just make a timer for this, but the resolution of the timers
is 1 second and that's almost too coarse-grained for the job.

IDEA: An actor cannot re-insert itself onto the ready-queue -- because even if an actor added
some code to the ready-queue for itself to run later, the actor-busy flag would still be a problem.
When the current function ended, the actor would negate the actor-busy flag, but the other body
of code would already be in the queue. Without its actor-busy flag (the flag is attached to the actor,
not to the lambda body in the ready-queue) the other lambda body could cause problems. We could
change the actor-busy flag to a semaphore so it could take on a integral value of how many times the
actor occurred in the queue, but I think a better solution is:

Just spin up another actor. We'll call it the echo-actor. And it's sole job will be to "reflect" a message
back to us. This way, an actor can cause a message to itself to get reinserted into the head of the queue
normally and that code will be executed later, if any other lambda bodies are in the queue ahead of it.
Because an actor cannot properly send a message to itself, but it can send a message to another actor that
gets sent back, and everything will be copacetic.

#| NOTES

NOTE A: About proactive reply cancellation
If node X is ignoring a solicitation* from node Y because it already
saw that solicitation, then it must also not expect a reply from node Y
for that same solicitation.
Here's why [In this scenario, imagine #'locally-receive-msg is acting on behalf of node X]:
If node X ignores a solicition from node Y -- because it's already seen that solicitation --
  then X knows the following:
  1. Node Y did not receive the solicition from X. It must have received it from somewhere else,
     because nodes *never* forward messages to their upstream.
  2. Therefore, if X forwards (or forwarded) the solicitation to Y, Y
     is definitely going to ignore it. Because Y has already seen it.
  3. Therefore (to recap) if X just ignored a solicitation from Y, then X
     knows Y is going to ignore that same solicitation from X.
  4. THEREFORE: X must not expect Y to respond, and that's why
     we call cancel-replier here. If we don't do this, Y will ignore
     and X will eventually time out, which it doesn't need to do.
  5. FURTHERMORE: Y knows X knows this. So it knows X will stop waiting for it.
* we take no special action for non-solicitation messages because they can't
  ever be replied to anyway.

NOTE B: About the repliers-expected slot.
This slot always contains a hashtable mapping a soluid to a value.
The value can be:
--Another hashtable, which maps srcuid to a subvalue. If subvalue is nil, it means this node
  expects a reply from srcuid for the soluid that represents this table. If the subvalue is non-nil,
  it can only be an interim-reply that srcuid has already sent. Future interim-replies from that srcuid
  will supersede older ones. (They will not be coalesced with older interim-replies; they replace them.)
  Subvalue will never be a final-reply because those don't get stored--they get coalesced with the value
  in reply-cache and stored in the reply-cache.
--The keyword :ANONYMOUS which indicates that replies from any srcuid are accepted. We don't expect to
  receive interim-replies from :ANONYMOUS repliers, so if we do receive any, they simply get dropped on
  the floor rather than stored. See Note C for more info.
--The value NIL, which indicates that no replies (or no further replies) are expected for this soluid.


NOTE C: About :ANONYMOUS expectations.
We have a mechanism to allow replies to a node to occur from unpredictable sources. This can happen
when we send a message with forward-to :NEIGHBORCAST or :GOSSIP but whose reply-to slot is a single UID.
In this case, there's no way to know who might reply in advance, so we have to allow replies (to this soluid)
from any srcuid. So in that case, we do
(kvs:relate-unique! (repliers-expected thisnode) soluid :ANONYMOUS)
to prepare for replies.
There are several implications here:
1. We cannot know in advance when we have received all possible replies. Thus we have to depend on a timeout
as the only mechanism to know when to ignore further replies (and to reply ourselves, if necessary).
Thus for a node expecting :ANONYMOUS replies, we must not call #'prepare-repliers for that node.
2. We don't allow interim-replies to :ANONYMOUS expectations, because we're not creating a table to keep them
(because in place of that table, we just have the keyword :ANONYMOUS), and because I don't think we'll ever need
interim-replies in this case.
3. We still allow coalescence at the node expecting :ANONYMOUS replies; they just always come from final-replies.
4. There's a possible hazard condition here: If a single node sends us two final-replies with the same soluid,
we won't know to reject the second one, and we'll coalesce a value from that node twice, which would cause
an incorrect coalescence result. We may have to care about this in future, but I'm not going to worry about
it now. In working code, there's no code path that would cause a node to respond with a final-reply for a given
soluid twice.

NOTE D: About :ANONYMOUS nodes

#'prepare-repliers is solely for use by a given node X when it is passing along a message whose reply-to slot
is :UPSTREAM. It should never be used for any other kind of reply-to, and in some cases it should not use even
in the :UPSTREAM case. Read on.

An :ANONYMOUS node is a proxy-node whose real-uid slot contains 0. It stands in for "every node" on some remote
machine. A regular proxy-node on machine A masquerades as the source of messages to local nodes on machine A, where
the actual source is actually on machine B. #'ensure-proxy-node is what makes this happen. But it NEVER happens
for :ANONYMOUS nodes. When a remote node on B responds to A, its message always comes in through a regular proxy-node
(which has a nonzero real-uid). Said proxy-node will be automatically created if it doesn't already exist.
Thus :ANONYMOUS nodes are always created manually -- never automatically -- and they're used for bootstrapping
a gossip network. And they're only used for outgoing messages -- never incoming.

Any regular gossip-node X which has an :ANONYMOUS node in its immediate downstream (its neighbors slot) MUST only
expect :ANONYMOUS replies. This is because the presence of even one :ANONYMOUS node in node X's downstream
means that node X can never be sure when all replies have occurred. Thus node X MUST NOT call #'prepare-repliers
in this case -- even if the reply-to happens to be :UPSTREAM.

Note that :ANONYMOUS nodes are essential for bootstrapping a gossip network that spans multiple machines--we
cannot just disallow them.

So why not just let all replies and all proxy-nodes be :ANONYMOUS?
Because with :ANONYMOUS replies, you can't ever be sure when you're done. You have to rely on timeouts to stop
waiting for replies. This is acceptable at boot time, but as proxy nodes for unique remote nodes are automatically
created, it's best to wire those into the gossip network as neighbors rather than :ANONYMOUS nodes, simply
because non-anonymous proxy nodes can have expectations set up for replies and thus not rely solely on timeouts.
Bottom line: Non-anonymous nodes are faster than anonymous ones.

This leads to another observation: Don't put :ANONYMOUS nodes into the neighbors slot of any node. That way,
you won't have to worry about :ANONYMOUS nodes being downstream, ever.

Furthermore, if node X passes along a direct-reply message (that is, its reply-to slot contains a UID), it must
never call #'prepare-repliers. This is pretty obvious at first glance, because in the case of direct replies,
node X is probably not going to be the replyee anyway. But what if it is? What if node X _is_ the replyee?
Even in that case, we can't always be sure that every downstream node is going to reply. If one of those
downstream nodes is an :ANONYMOUS node, it'll never reply (because anonymous nodes never masquerade as the source of
reply messages). And direct messages can be weird: Any given downstream node may or may not choose to even accept
the message, let alone reply to it. Direct messages are in some sense intended to be weird. They're for bootstrapping
or out-of-band status purposes or whatever. The point is, only :UPSTREAM solicitations should ever definitively
expect replies from specific downstream nodes, and even then, only in the case where there's no :ANONYMOUS node in
the downstream set.

A subtlety: Note that coalescence is a different issue than expectations. It's possible that a node will want to coalesce
its replies without having any expectations as to who will reply. This is precisely the case for node X, where node X
is expecting direct replies to itself. See generic-srr-handler method for solicitations for how this is coded.

NOTE E: Debugging Actor code
If it seems like -- contrary to all expectations -- messages are never getting delivered to a given actor,
check the processes window. If a given Actor Executive shows "Active" rather than "Waiting for Actor", that's
a HUGE red flag. It means some Actor's code body never exited. And that actor will appear to have stopped
receiving messages.
In ccl, you can interrupt and backtrace a background process like so:
(ccl::force-break-in-listener (gossip::find-process <process-name>))


TODO:
Ensure that anonymous nodes can never be in neighbors slot.
Figure out a way to make solicit-direct work in that case.
