;;; gossip.lisp

;;; More realistic gossip protocol.
;;; Minimal changes to use actor concurrency model. As far as the actors are concerned,
;;;  we're just sending messages of type :gossip, regardless of whether they're solicitations,
;;;  replies, or timeouts.
;;; Gossip messages are simply sent as payload of a lower-level actor message.
;;; No more process-run-function because actors take care of that.
;;; No need for locks to access node data structures because they're always accessed from an actor's single thread.

;;; New mechanism: Interim replies instead of carefully-timed timeouts.

;;;; TODO:
;;;; Change things such that when *use-all-neighbors* is an integer, if a node gets an active ignore back from
;;;;  neighbor X, it should pick another neighbor if it has more available.

;;;; NOTES: "Upstream" means "back to the solicitor: the node that sent me a solicitation in the first place"

Discussion: :gossip style is more realistic for "loose" networks where nodes don't know much about their neighbors.
:neighborcast style is better after :gossip style has been used to discover the graph topology and agreements about collaboration
are in place between nodes.

; NOTE A:
; If node X is ignoring a solicitation* from node Y because it already
; saw that solicitation, then it must also not expect a reply from node Y
; for that same solicitation.
; Here's why [In this scenario, imagine #'locally-receive-msg is acting on behalf of node X]:
; If node X ignores a solicition from node Y -- because it's already seen that solicitation --
;   then X knows the following:
;   1. Node Y did not receive the solicition from X. It must have received it from somewhere else,
;      because nodes *never* forward messages to their upstream.
;   2. Therefore, if X forwards (or forwarded) the solicitation to Y, Y
;      is definitely going to ignore it. Because Y has already seen it.
;   3. Therefore (to recap) if X just ignored a solicitation from Y, then X
;      knows Y is going to ignore that same solicitation from X.
;   4. THEREFORE: X must not expect Y to respond, and that's why
;      we call cancel-replier here. If we don't do this, Y will ignore
;      and X will eventually time out, which it doesn't need to do.
;   5. FURTHERMORE: Y knows X knows this. So it knows X will stop waiting for it.
;
; * we take no special action for non-solicitation messages because they can't
;   ever be replied to anyway.

DISCUSSION:
send-interim-reply needs to be delayed, and I don't know how to do this with actors.
interim-replies don't resolve anything in the gossip model; they just provide (sometimes valuable)
partial information to the ultimate solicitor. However, if things are moving along properly,
a huge flurry of almost content-free interim-replies doesn't accomplish anything except to
clog up communication.

I don't want to get rid of interim-replies altogether because they'll be needed in cases of any
malfunctioning nodes. But I'd like to delay them a bit -- put them on the actor's back-burner
as it were.
Specifically what I need is a way to tell an actor
1. Put the send-interim-reply on the back burner and if nothing usurps it, execute it after a 1 second
delay.
2. If a send-final-reply happens, remove any send-interim-reply requests from the back-burner.
3. If a second send-interim-reply request comes in when one is already on the back-burner, do nothing,
because the original will take care of it. However, do reset the clock to make it execute 1 second
from now, rather than 1 second from whatever time the original request set up.

There are a couple of tricky issues here I don't know how to solve:
-- How to create a local "back-burner" queue on an actor. Conceivably this could just be another slot
on an actor, and #'next-message could be made to look at it last. Or possibly it could be put on the
actor-message-mbox at lowest priority?
-- How to ensure the actor gets put back on the *actor-ready-queue* 1 second from now.

Another solution might be to just give actors a "yield" capability such that they put themselves back
onto the far end of the *actor-ready-queue* and give other actors (or technically, other messages to
themselves) a chance to run first.

Can an actor be on the *actor-ready-queue* more than once? I would hope so. But no. The queue doesn't even
really contain actors per se; it just contains lexical closures, all of which are associated with some
actor. However, the way #'send works is that it never re-adds an actor's run closure to the queue if the
actor is already busy.

I suppose the simplest solution is to just make a timer for this, but the resolution of the timers
is 1 second and that's almost too coarse-grained for the job.

IDEA: An actor cannot re-insert itself onto the ready-queue -- because even if an actor added
some code to the ready-queue for itself to run later, the actor-busy flag would still be a problem.
When the current function ended, the actor would negate the actor-busy flag, but the other body
of code would already be in the queue. Without its actor-busy flag (the flag is attached to the actor,
not to the lambda body in the ready-queue) the other lambda body could cause problems. We could
change the actor-busy flag to a semaphore so it could take on a integral value of how many times the
actor occurred in the queue, but I think a better solution is:

Just spin up another actor. We'll call it the echo-actor. And it's sole job will be to "reflect" a message
back to us. This way, an actor can cause a message to itself to get reinserted into the head of the queue
normally and that code will be executed later, if any other lambda bodies are in the queue ahead of it.
Because an actor cannot properly send a message to itself, but it can send a message to another actor that
gets sent back, and everything will be copacetic.
