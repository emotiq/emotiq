;;;; Genesis Block Creation

;;; In Bitcoin the first transaction of a block is created by a miner, and it's
;;; a special transaction with one input that's very wacky called a coinbase
;;; transaction with a so-called coinbase input. While every other transaction
;;; on the blockchain has as input a reference to a previous transaction, a
;;; coinbase transaction refers to a "null" transaction.

;;; Coinbase transaction are the main way coin gets into the system in
;;; Bitcoin. The other way is through transaction fees. In Bitcoin the miner who
;;; creates the block creates the coinbase transaction and is awarded the mining
;;; fee. The coinbase transaction issues one output to one address and that is
;;; to the miner's "wallet", i.e, their account (i.e., designated by their
;;; public key hash), and that is in the amount of the current block reward,
;;; which famously know gets halved every four years (currently [2018] 12.5
;;; BTC). So that's mining, and Emotiq does not feature mining.

;;; In addition to the mining reward, the coinbase transaction includes fees for
;;; the miner. That's a way for Bitcoin to pay a little more besides mining
;;; fees, and will be the only way miners get paid after miner awards approach
;;; and eventually reach zero.

;;; Now, since we, Emotiq, do not feature mining, what do we do at block
;;; creation time with the first transaction. I.e., how does the main amount of
;;; coin get into the system? Here is the answer.

;;; The Emotiq Whitepaper states that an initial supply of 10^9 coins will be
;;; created when EMTQ mainnet is launched. So, the genesis block would contain
;;; transactions paying 10^9 to one address (TBD), and from there onto others as
;;; desired.


;;;; Coin and Token Units

;;; NB: while the Emotiq Whitepaper talks of EMTQ tokens and EMTQ child tokens,
;;; this is probably simpler than what's there and probably does not match the
;;; level of sophistication implied there.

;;; At a later point we might switch to the term "token", but for now we're
;;; using coin", as follows.  

;;; A `coin unit' or more simply `unit' or `coin' (and plural versions with
;;; `units' or `coins') all refer the fully valued coin in the cyrpto currency
;;; here implemented.

;;; A `coin subunit' or `subunit' (plural `subunits') all refer to the smallest
;;; fraction of a coin unit.

;;; A `coin amount' or `amount' is a number of coin subunits.

;;; When expressing a number of units messages with users, it is fine to use
;;; floats or ratios, but as a coding convention internally we use integer math
;;; only, via the following constants.

;;; float, ratio, integer), convert it to the closest integer number of

;;; The following is from the OmniLedger paper. We would like to incorporate
;;; this into transaction processing.  This is referred to as "V. B." in the
;;; "Emotiq Yellow Paper" in our repo
;;; online. (https://github.com/emotiq/yellowpaper/blob/master/yellowpaper.md).
;;;
;;;   B. Parallelizing Block Commitments We now show how ByzCoinX parallelizes
;;;   block commitments in the UTXO model by carefully analyzing and handling
;;;   dependencies between transactions. We observe that transactions that do
;;;   not conflict with each other can be committed in different blocks and
;;;   consequently can be safely processed in parallel. To identify conflicting
;;;   transactions, we need to analyze the dependencies that are possible
;;;   between transactions. Let txA and txB denote two transactions. Then, there
;;;   are two cases that need to be carefully handled: (1) both txA and txB try
;;;   to spend the same UTXO and (2) an UTXO created at the output of txA is
;;;   spent at the input of txB (or vice versa). To address (1) and maintain
;;;   consistency, only one of the two tx can be committed. To address (2), txA
;;;   has to be committed to the ledger before txB,i.e., txB has to be in a
;;;   block that depends (transitively) on the block containing txA. All
;;;   transactions that do not exhibit these two properties can be processed
;;;   safely in parallel. In particular we remark that transactions that credit
;;;   the same address do not produce a conflict, because they generate
;;;   different UTXOs To capture the concurrent processing of blocks, we adopt a
;;;   block-based directed acyclic graph (blockDAG) [33] as a data structure,
;;;   where every block can have multiple parents. The ByzCoinX protocol leader
;;;   enforces that each pending block includes only non-conflicting
;;;   transactions and captures UTXO dependencies by adding the hashes of former
;;;   blocks (i.e.,backpointers) upon which a given block’s transactions
;;;   depend. To decrease the number of such hashes, we remark that UTXO
;;;   dependencies are transitive, enabling us to relax the requirement that
;;;   blocks have to capture all UTXO dependencies directly. Instead, a given
;;;   block can simply add backpointers to a set of blocks, transitively
;;;   capturing all dependencies.
;;;
;;; Here is the referenced "blockDAG" paper URL (Inclusive Block Chain
;;; Protocols):
