> (ql:quickload :emotiq/node)
> (emotiq:node)

You should see an "emotiq>" prompt, at which you can type 'help'.



To get the simulator to work on a single machine:

change the IP address in node-sim.lisp

> (ql:quickload :emotiq/sim)
> (cosi-simgen:enode)

On LispWorks, open an Output-Browser to see the output.  Other lisps, the output ends up
