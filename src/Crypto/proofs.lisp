Any commitment, written as C = H^x, in bent nomenclature, can be
rewritten in log form as log C = x*log H. where log H = alpha * log G
= alpha, considering group element G as the identity element for
exponentiation, or base of the log i.e., the base generator of the
cryptosystem over the curve on which C and H are defined.

So, a Pedersen commitment of the form C = H^gamma * G^x can be
rewritten as log C = gamma * log H + x * log G = gamma * log H + x, for
independent generators G, H.

In un-bent nomenclature that Pedersen commitment would be written as
C = gamma * H + x * G, where H = alpha * G for some randomly selected
alpha. So unbent nomenclature is already in log form.

We share knowledge of H, G, C, and keep x, gamma hidden. When asked to
open the commitment for C we rturn x, always keeping randomness gamma
hidden.

A commitment in the form C = x*G is computationally binding, but not
hiding, because anyone capable of performing ECDLP can solve for x. A
commitment of the form C' = gamma*H + x*G, for random gamma and
independent generator H, is both computationally binding and hiding
because the ability to perform ECDLP does not help in the face of
unknmown randomness gamma, and there is no known relationship between
generators H and G.

To build a proof that x = v, we need to provide a commitment to x and
offer a function of random variable z, such that the challenger cnn
predict the answer to the function F(z) given our commitment, as well
as have us perform the computation and return an answer that can be
matched, without giving away any information about the binding value
for x.

  "Make a Pedersen commitment to x with computational binding, and

Publish Cx, H, and G.

Proof is by way noting that for random challenge, z, prover supplies
values for alpha, L, and R, where:

    alpha = z * gamma + (1/z) * x
    L = x * H
    R = gamma * G

Then verifier computes:

    G' = (1/z) * H + z * G
    C' = (1/z^2) * L + C + z^2 * R

and sees that

    alpha * G' = C'

which proves knowledge of both factors, gamma and x.

We invoke Shamir conversion to NIZKP by using the hash of the
transcript as the random challenge value, z.

Note, that if x comes from a small domain, and by way of knowing both
H and L = x*H, it is possible for a brute force search to determine x.
So small domain values must be cloaked. See below..."

  "Make a proof of cloaked value with binding commitments on x and a
random cloaking value, a.

We provide two Pedersen commitments with proofs, for a and (x-a) using
independent generators G, H. Pedersen commitments have the form

   C = gamma*H + v*G,

for a binding commitment to value v, with random hiding factor
gamma.

Since cloaking value, a, is randomly selected from the entire domain
of the curve field, it is safe to reveal partial knowledge through
L = a*H during the proof. And similarly for (x - a)*H. Brute force
search is infeasible.

We publish the two Pedersen commitment proofs. Then we provide a proof
on the Pedersen commitment for x by showing that

   Cx = gamma-x * H + x * G
      = Cx-a + Ca + hAdj * H.

Since

   Ca = gamma-a * H + a * G

and

   Cx-a = gamma-ax * H + (x - a) * G

the sum in G is obvious. But to match the (gamma-x * H) term we need an
adjustment in the H curve, of the form:

   hAdj = (gamma-x - (gamma-ax + gamma-a))

We have already proven binding knowledge of hiding factors gamma-a
and gamma-ax, and also on a and (x-a), in the two Pedersen commitments
with proofs.

Given that H and G are independent, the sum of commitments proof shows
that knowledge of all three gamma are present.  And the fact that
adjustment is needed only on the H curve shows that x = (x - a) + a in
the G curve.

All three gamma are random values sampled from the entire domain of
the curve. So publishing hAdj reveals nothing. Brute force search
remains infeasible.

Note that we cannot provide a Pedersen proof for x alone, as that
would show a value of L = x*H during the proof. And since x may be
from a small domain, and knowing H, it would be simple to perform
brute-force search to find x."
